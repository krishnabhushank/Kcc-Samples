In Kubernetes, you can list all supported resource kinds using the `kubectl api-resources` command. This command queries the Kubernetes API server and returns a list of all available resource types (kinds) in the cluster. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### List All Supported Resource Kinds

1. **Basic Command**:

   To list all resource kinds, run the following command:

   ```sh
   kubectl api-resources
   ```

   This will display a table with columns for the name, short names, API group, namespace scope, and kind. For example:

   ```plaintext
   NAME                              SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION                             NAMESPACED   KIND
   bindings                                       v1                                     true         Binding
   componentstatuses                cs           v1                                     false        ComponentStatus
   configmaps                       cm           v1                                     true         ConfigMap
   endpoints                        ep           v1                                     true         Endpoints
   events                           ev           v1                                     true         Event
   ...
   ```

2. **Detailed Information**:

   To get more detailed information about each resource kind, you can use the `-o wide` flag:

   ```sh
   kubectl api-resources -o wide
   ```

   This will add columns for the verbs (actions supported by the resource) and categories.

3. **Filtering by API Group**:

   If you are interested in resources from a specific API group, you can use the `--api-group` flag. For example, to list resources in the `apps` API group:

   ```sh
   kubectl api-resources --api-group=apps
   ```

   This will filter the list to show only the resources belonging to the specified API group.

### Example

Here is a more comprehensive example that lists all resource kinds along with their detailed information:

```sh
kubectl api-resources -o wide
```

Output:

```plaintext
NAME                              SHORTNAMES   APIGROUP                       NAMESPACED   KIND                             VERBS
bindings                                       v1                             true         Binding                          [create]
componentstatuses                cs           v1                             false        ComponentStatus                  [get list]
configmaps                       cm           v1                             true         ConfigMap                        [create delete deletecollection get list patch update watch]
endpoints                        ep           v1                             true         Endpoints                        [create delete deletecollection get list patch update watch]
events                           ev           v1                             true         Event                            [create delete deletecollection get list patch update watch]
persistentvolumeclaims           pvc          v1                             true         PersistentVolumeClaim            [create delete deletecollection get list patch update watch]
...
```

### Notes

- **Namespaced**: The `NAMESPACED` column indicates whether the resource is namespaced (`true`) or cluster-scoped (`false`).
- **Verbs**: The `VERBS` column shows the actions that can be performed on the resource, such as `create`, `delete`, `get`, `list`, `update`, etc.
- **API Group**: The `APIGROUP` column shows the API group to which the resource belongs. Resources in the `core` group have an empty `APIGROUP` field.

Using these commands, you can get a comprehensive list of all the resource kinds supported by your Kubernetes cluster, including detailed information about each kind.
